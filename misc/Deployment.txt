Deployment Checklist:
    This checklist is for deployment on production systems. Any testing deployment should be done using the same virtualenvs and instructions provided in the other README files. This deployment guideline is for use by Graeme and Ben Miller to actually deploy.

	Web Zone:
		Install a python prefixed into the chroot
		Install the necessary depdencies into the prefixed python install
		Update all relevent options in config.py
		Modify the .wsgi file to point to the prefix python install and the absolute path of the accounts directory
		Modify httpd.conf to use the wsgi file
		Modify accounts/scripts/import_passwd.py to point to your accounts.txt and research.txt NIS maps
		Modify accounts/scripts/import_old_db.py to point to the old MySQL database
			python accounts -r
			python accounts -s import_passwd
			python accounts -s import_old_db
		(If the htpasswd file used it not called htpasswd, that needs to be changed in code. Similarly for htgroup)
	    Start Apache
	
	Login Servers:
	    First, read all of the relevent README files, particularly in the scripts/ directory.
	    Use similar modifications to config.py to point to the proper services
	    Make the necessary crontab modifications as outlined in the aforementioned README scripts

Cracklib Library:
	Cracklib requires several hacks to compile on solaris
	setenv CFLAGS "-D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS"
	cracklib and ctypescracklib.py are used in this project, both are included in the accounts package,
	with libcrack.so.2 preocompiled for solaris
