ECE/CIS Account Management System Documentation

================================================
Quickstart Guide: 
================================================ 
For convenience, some scripts to setup and install all necessary dependencies have
been provided. The following instructions are the de facto instructions for
running the software in an environment where all the features are to be tested.
This must be done on the account VM (account.acad.cis.udel.edu), as CAS authentication relies on the
software running on the accounts VM.

If you do not wish to run this on the account VM, CAS authentication will be
broken, so you cannot test password reset or registration for users who have
udel accounts.

First, make sure you have a checkout of the code.

To run on the accounts VM, first you will need a python virtualenv which
contains all the dependencies. A script has been provided to automatically
create and setup the virtualenv, and also to install a recent version of Python
since the one on the VM is out of date.

Note: this readme assumes you are using a shell such as bash. 
While it is still possible to use a c shell, the included scripts are not written for it,
 because setting up the environment dependencies with it is more complicated.

In the root of whichever tag/branch you are attempting to run, execute the
following: 
$ /bin/bash misc/virtualenv_setup_solaris.sh 
$ source ~/python-virtualenv/bin/activate.csh

On future runs, you do not need to run the virtualenv setup, only 
$ source ~/python-virtualenv/bin/activate.csh

Next, we need to copy the example config file. 
$ cp accounts/config_example.py   accounts/config.py

All of the defaults should be perfectly fine for your testing. Next, we populate
the database with some default testing values. 
$ python accounts --reset-db

Now, you can choose what you wish to run. To see the available options, run the
following: 
$ python accounts -h

The majority of the code is the web interface, which you can enable with 
$ python accounts --server 
and you can visit at:
http://account.acad.cis.udel.edu:5050

For scripts, you can see the available scripts by looking at the
accounts/scripts directory.

And thus concludes the tutorial.

OS X/Linux Instructions: 
================================================
Prerequisites: Python 2.7 and a build toolchain. If python2.7 does not, for some
reason, point to a python2.7 executable, you should edit the beginning of
`./misc/unix.sh`. In the directory that this readme is in (usually trunk or a
tag), run `./misc/unix.sh`, and then follow the provided instructions. Also
glance at the above instructions in the quickstart.

================================================
Windows Instructions: 
================================================
ssh into the accounts VM and go back up to the quickstart.
