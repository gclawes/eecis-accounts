These modules all provide an interface for the account scripts 
to interact with the login systems.
This interface is described in stub_auth.py, which is never called by the scripts.

Each module contains settings specific to that module, 
these should be modified depending on what domain they are deployed on.

Current modules are:
nis_unix.py:
	-Interface with NIS source files in /var/yp/src
	-New accounts are added to /var/yp/src/{passwd+,group+}
	-Changes (password/shell/gecos) are applied to /var/yp/src/{password,group}.local
	-Deletes are applied to /var/yp/src/{password,group}.local

ldap_unix.py:
	-Adds entries to the LDAP server running on the ypmaster for a domain
	-This module directly calls the external ldap programs (ldapmodify,ldapadd)
		As such, it contains the LDAP password and should be protected.
	-The information in unix LDAP mirrors that in NIS
	-This module does NOT add NTLM passwords

ldap_smb.py:
	-Adds entries to the Samba LDAP server running on smb-ldap1, which is replicated to
		smb-ldap1.acad.ece.
	-This module should only be run on the acad ypmaster, because all research accounts
		are also acad accounts
	-This module does NOT add unix passwords!
