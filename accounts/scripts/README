These are the backend scripts that run on the ypmasters for each domain,
as well as scripts used for migration.

create.py - runs as root on each ypmaster (dilbert, devil-rays)
    and handles account creation. 

process-changes.py - run as part of passwd.time in /var/yp/Makefile 
    on each ypmaster before NIS maps are created.  
    It processes changes to logins such as password, 
    shell, and GECOS changes.  Changes are applied to all login 
    methods in auth_modules (see auth_modules/README).

    This replaces the spasswd processing script, password changes
    now follow the same code path for web and command-line changes.

remind.py - Runs on ONE ypmaster server (dilbert) and sends notifications
    to faculty sponsors if they have user applications awaiting approval.


rolloff.py - interface for starring passwords for rolloffs, and marking 
    rolled-off accounts in the database.
    NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

Migration scripts:
    import_old_db.py - used for migrating old web DB
    import_passwd.py - used for importing current NIS maps to DB
